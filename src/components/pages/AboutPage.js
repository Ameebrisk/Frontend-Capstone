        I began my frontend development journey learning html and css. I learned
        to build skeletons in html before applying styles with css. We moved
        into scss for styling and learned that it was easier than plain css and
        we can nest our styles and so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we moved into javascript. Javascript was a little more of a
        challenge for me. I learned that functions are objects and that
        variables and functions are hoisted to the top of the scope. I would
        also like to revisit javascript in time to become more confident.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last few weeks of the course we moved into React. React is a
        user interface, it creates more dynamic web apps. It uses jsx and we
        also covered the main concepts of react. We learned how to read
        documentation and where to find information for research. I have gained
        so much knowledge from the front end course! I appreciate Ryan Curtis
        for the time he has taken to teach me and for everything I have learned
        this far.
